# Web Media Player Launcher

This is a lightweight C++ GUI launcher for the Web Media Player project, built using the Win32 API.

## Compilation

To compile the launcher, you need to have a C++ compiler toolchain installed, such as MinGW-w64.

Once you have the toolchain, you can compile the project by running the `make` command in this directory:

```bash
make
```

This will produce a `launcher.exe` executable file.

## Usage

Run the `launcher.exe` file to start the application.
